# Dog Breed Classification Project

Welcome to the Dog Breed Classification Project! This project aims to accurately identify the breed of a dog from an image using a powerful deep-learning model. The model is trained with advanced techniques to achieve high accuracy, making it a reliable tool for dog breed identification.

- ML Model: This four-legged breed identifier is powered and trained by the incredible PyTorch.

## Model Mastery

- Accuracy Extraordinaire: Our model boasts a whopping 97.54% accuracy.

- Breeds Bonanza: Trained with love on 30 diverse breeds from across the globe.ation: Utilizes weather data to optimize plant care schedules.

## Technical Details
- Framework: PyTorch, Python
- Model Architecture: ResNet-50
- Training Technique: Transfer Learning

## Key Files
- model_training.py: This script contains the code for training the model. It handles data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- prediction_dog.py: This script is used to test the model. You can classify a new dog image by running this script. Ensure you update the image path in the script to point to your dog image.

## Model File

- model_checkpoint_epoch_6.pth: This is the latest model file, containing the trained weights of the model. You can use this file to load the model and make predictions.
Usage

## Training the Model:

Run model_training.py to train the model on your dataset. Make sure you have the necessary data and dependencies set up.

## Testing the Model:

Use prediction_dog.py to classify a new dog image. Change the image path in the script to the path of the dog image you want to classify.

## Production

Check out the production version of the model in action at Pupteller

This link: https://pupteller.netlify.app/ will take you to a web application where you can upload an image of a dog, and it will predict the breed using the trained model.
